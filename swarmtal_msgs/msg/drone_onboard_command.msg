# For POS param1 2 3 is x y z * 10000 
# 4 is yaw*10000 if yaw =666666, then use last yawsp
# 567 is vel feedforward

# For VEL param1 2 3 is x y z * 10000 
# 4 is yaw*10000 if yaw =666666, then use last yawsp

# For ATT 
# param1 2 3 4 is roll pitch yaw vz * 10000 
# 5 (>0 use thrust else z is velz)
# 6 (>0 use yaw else yawrate) 
# For TAKEoff param 1 is takeoff height * 10000
# For arm param = 0 is disarm param>0 is arm
